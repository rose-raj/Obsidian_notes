### Project Desperation
This project fetches top news headlines from an Indian news source using the NewsAPI. Each article is summarized into 2–3 concise sentences using the Gemini API. A representative image will be generated for each headline, and both the image and summary will be displayed as a flashcard on a web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Core Components:**

- **Python Backend**
    
    - Fetches top 5 headlines using NewsAPI.
        
    - Summarizes content using Gemini 1.5 Flash API.
        
    - (Planned) Generates images relevant to the headline.
        
- **Frontend (Planned)**
    
    - Progressive Web App (PWA) using HTML/CSS/JS.
        
    - Displays flashcards with headline images and summaries.

## Description V2


- A Decentralized Patient Medical History Platform for India
- To build a **secure, decentralized platform** that **unifies and shares patient medical histories across hospitals in India**, enabling doctors to access life-saving information during emergencies, while maintaining **patient privacy, control, and legal compliance**.
- a **blockchain-based medical data-sharing system** designed for India’s healthcare ecosystem. The goal is to create a **unified, patient-centric medical record infrastructure** that allows any authorized hospital in the network to **instantly access a patient's medical history** — especially in emergencies — with **patient consent and strong privacy safeguards**.

Instead of storing sensitive data directly on the blockchain, we use **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)** to securely store encrypted medical records off-chain, while a **blockchain ledger stores cryptographic hashes, permissions, and access logs** to ensure tamper-proof history and verifiability.

Access is managed via **OAuth2 authentication**, where patients can grant or revoke access to hospitals. In critical situations, **emergency access is granted via a patient-owned token or biometric override**, ensuring care is never delayed. All access is fully **auditable** and traceable by the patient.

The platform is designed with **India-only accessibility**, respecting national data sovereignty and the **Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act**.

 - **Decentralized and tamper-proof** record system via blockchain
    
-  **Secure off-chain encrypted storage** using IPFS
    
- **OAuth2-based access control** with patient permission
    
-  **Emergency access mechanism** via token or biometric 
    
- **Access logs & audit trail** for transparency and accountability
    
- **Geo-restricted to India only** for legal compliance
    
-  **Web interface** for patients and hospitals to interact with the system

- India's health infrastructure is seriously challenged in the sharing of patient medical histories between hospitals, resulting in delays and mistakes during emergency situations. Files are usually fragmented, unavailable, or written, undermining patient care and safety. Given growing demand for digital health technology solutions and greater emphasis on data protection under the DPDP Act, a fast-growing need exists for a secure, interoperable, and patient-controlled framework. A decentralized blockchain platform guarantees tamper-proof access, real-time availability, and compliance—filling gaps in continuity of care and empowering the patient within a fast-digitizing healthcare environment.
- The solution is a decentralized, blockchain-based platform built with Polygon or Hyperledger, IPFS for encrypted off-chain storage, and OAuth2 for secure access control. It unifies patient medical histories across Indian hospitals, allowing patients to manage access and permissions. Emergency access is enabled via biometric or token-based overrides. Smart contracts ensure tamper-proof logging, while React, Node.js/FastAPI, and Solidity power the web interface and backend. The system is fully auditable and compliant with India’s DPDP Act, ensuring real-time, privacy-preserving, and transparent access to critical health data across the healthcare network.
- This is a one-of-a-kind platform that uses blockchain, IPFS, and OAuth2 to build a completely decentralized, patient-owned medical record system that is specific to India. It differs from centralized systems because it provides tamper-proof logging, securestorage off-chain, and real-time, consent-based access to all hospitals. Emergency overrides through biometric/token accessprevent delays in care. Geo-restriction and adherence to the DPDP Act make it legally practicable. Its cloud-free, open-source design renders it scalable and cost-effective for Indian healthcare infrastructure, giving patients transparency, control, and privacy—unparalleled by any other solution.
- Unlike traditional centralized health record systems or cloud-based EHR platforms, our solution is fully decentralized. using blockchain for tamper-proof access logs and IPFS for secure, encrypted off-chain storage. Patients have complete control over who accesses their data via OAuth2-based permissions with an emergency override system for critical cases. Competitor systems often lack interoperability, real-time consent management and patient transparency Additionally, our platform is designed to run without cloud dependency, ensuring cost efficiency and compliance with India’s DPDP Act through geo-restriction features rarely offered together in existing market solutions.
